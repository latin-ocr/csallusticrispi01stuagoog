ΤΟ THE

CONSPIRAOY OF OATILINE.

INTRODUGTION.

'sna subject of the Catilina or Bellum catilinarium is the
conspiracy of Lucius Sergius Catilina against the city and gor· Α
ernment ol Rome, B. C, 63. The conspiracy embraeed the murder
of many distinguished Roman citizens, the burning of Rome, the
proscription of persons aud the confiscation of property, and, gen-
erally, the entire subversion of the existing order of things, with
Catilius and his adherente at the head of affairs.

The lise os the great conspirator was stained with the darhest

crimes. In addition to othermurdere, he killed, with his own hand,
his brother-in-law, and, according to soms authorities, hie brother
also 3 while a well-grounded suspicion pointed to him as the mur-
derer of his wife and son. His violeus nature seemed to find a
congenial sphsre in deeds oi violence, and in urging on others,
ι particularly the young, to crime.

Catiline, though a monsterol wickednoss, possessed grem natural
abilities, and filled several important offioes: he had been quaestor
in the army oi Sulla; he was praetor in Rome in B. (l. ⁶83 pro-
praetor οἰ Africa in the following year3 and even while engaged
in matur-ing his conspiracy, was twice a candidate for the consul-
ship. His great hope had been, as the first magistrate of the
commonwealth, to use the arm of the government itself to exeunte
his nefarious designs, and as both his applicatione for the eonsul-
ship terminated unsuecessfully, he now resolved to throw off re-
straint and prooeed to open violence. 'l'he conspiracy was ma·
tured toward the close ol B. O. 63, and was an extensive one, em-
braoingnoless than eleven senators, four members oi the equestrian
order, besides many men of rank and intluence in the provinces.
Maganines of arms were secretly formed, and troops were levied in
various parts of Italy, especially in the neighborhood ol Faesulae,
