ΤΟ THE

JUGURTHINE WAR,

INTRODUGTION.

Jusosrss, hing of Numidia, was a grandson of Masinissa, being
a son of his youngest son, Mastanabal; buton account of his ille-
gitimate birth- his mother being only aconcubine — he was neglect·
ed by his grandfather, and remaincd in aprivate situation so long as
Masinissa lived. But when Micipsa succecded ιο the throne (B. G.
149), he adopted his nephew, and caused him ιο be brought up
with his own sons, Hiempsal aad Adherbal. Jugurtha quiclsly
distinguished himself, both by his abilities and his skill in all bodily
exercises, and rose to so much favor and popularity with the N u-
midians, that be began to excite the J'ealousy of Micipsa, who
became apprehensive lest hs should eventually supplent his two
sons. In order to remove him to a distance, and not without a
hope that he might perish in the war, Micipsa sent him, in Β. Ο.
134, with an auxiliary force, ιο assist Scipio against Numantia;
but this only proved to the young man a fresh 'occasion of distinc-
tion: by his seul, courage, and ability, he gained the favor not only
of his commender, but of all the leading nobles in the Roman camp,
’ by many of whom he was secretly stimulated ιο nourish ambitious
schemes for acquiring the sole sovereignty of Numidia, and not-
withstanding the contrary advice of Scipio, these counsels seem to
havesunlr deep into the mind of Jugurtha. On his return, he was
received with every demonstration of honor by Micipsa5 nor did
he allow his ambitious projecte to break forth during the lifetime
of theold man. Micipsa, on his death-hed, though but too clearly
foreseeing what would huppen, commended the two young princes
ιο the care of J ugurtha3 but at the very first interview which took
place between them after his deeease (B. C. 118), their dissensione

broke out with the utmost fierceness. Shortly after, ,Iugurtha found
an opportunity ιο surprise and assassinate Hiempsal in his lodging
