01 'l'hirmlda; whereupon Adherbal and his partisans rushed to ’
arms, but were defeated in battle by J ugurtha: and Adherbal him· ’
0011 flod for refuge 10 the Roman province, from whence be hastened

¹ to Rome, to lay his cause before the senate. Jugurtha bad now the
opportunity 01 pntting to the test that which hc had learned in the
camp before Numantia, 01 the venality and corruption of the Roman

nobility: he sent ambassadors to Rome 10 0000101001, by a lavish
distribution of bribes, tbe 0110010 01 the just complaints of Adherbal,
and by these means sncceeded in averting the indignation of tbe
senate. A decree was however passed for the division 01 the kingdom
of Numidia between thetwocompetito1s; and although Jugurtba
obtained by sartha larger and richer portion of the two, be was by
no means contented, but continnally harassed the frontiers of the
neighboring kingdom,in hopes of iuducing Adherbal to repress tbcsa
petty assaults by arms. The patience and steadiness with which
Adherbal adbered to a 0001110 0οᾱ defensive system frustrated these .
hopes, and Jugurtha at length invaded bis territories with a large
army. Adherbal was defeated 10 tbe first 00011101, and though two
successive deputatione from Rome commanded both parties 10 desist
from hostilities, he was shortly after (B. C. 112) captured and imme-
diately putto death. War was therefore deelared against the N u-
midian king, and one 01 the 0000010, 1.. Calpurnius Bestia, lauded
in Africa with a large army, and though several 1101000οο01-
manders successively undertook the conduct 01 lhe war, such was
their avarica or incapacity, that tbo general result was simply fail-
ure and diagrace. Nor was any headway made against ¹«Iugurtha
until the arrival 01 the consul Q. Caecilius Metellus (B. 0. 109),
wbo at 0000 began 10 retrieve the honor of the Roman arms3 and
though Metellus met with some reverses, he would doubtless have
brought the war to a successful termination, had not Caius Marius
been appointed 10 00000οἀ him. “
The arrival of Marius infused fresh vigor into the Roman arms.
Success followed upon 0000000, 00111, finally, the defection of J ugur-
tha’a ally, Bocchus, king 01 Mauritania, gave the finishing stroke
to the war. Bocchus was gained over by Sulla, the quaestor 01
Μο1100, and he joined in a plan for seising the 001000 01 1110 llu-
midian king. J ugurtha fell into the snare. He was induced, under
pretence of a 0001010000,10 100011, with only a few followers, 10
01001 Bocchus, when he was instantly surrounded, his attendants
cut to pieces, and ho himself made prisoner, and delivered in chains
10 Sulla, by whom he was conveyad directlyto 1110 camp of Marius.
