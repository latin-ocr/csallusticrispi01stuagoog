works, as previously stated, were probably all written after his
retirement from public life, though the composition of each of
them hasbeen assigned to widely different dates.

Sallust has always been regarded as a charming writer.
Among Roman authors he is certainly unsurpassed in the art
of historical composition. His stylo is one altogether peculiar,
and is characterized hy a sententious brevity, He is the most
concise amdng the Roman writers of the golden age. With
him style was evidently a matter of primary importante. He
made Thucydides his modeh and studied a pointed style, ren-
dered more forcihle hy antithesis and contrast. There is this
difference, however, between the Greek and the Roman: “ The
brevity ot* Thucydides is the result of condensation; that os
Sallust iselliptical expression. He gives a hint‚ and the readcr
must supply the rest: whilst Thucydides only expects hispead·
ers to unfold and develop ideas which already existed in a
concentrated form. Sallust requires addition ; Thucydides dilu-
tion and expansion.’' (Browce’s Rom. otras. [riti

He is perhaps over-fond of certain antique forms and modes ·
of expression, and clings too tenaciously to the old orthography
at a time when the new was becoming very generally adopted.
Yet “in the Catilina and Jugurtha there is not a single word
used which is not also of frequent occurrence in contemporary
and later writers.” (Metanoia.) Niebuhr remarks that Sallust
“ preserves the old phraseology with a predilection guided hy
learning and judgment,'' and Aulus Gellius speaks of him as
“ proprietatum in verbis retinentissimus.” His attempt to imi-
tate, rather than follow tho hent of his own genius, not unfre-
quently develops in his style more of art than of nature, and
more artistic polish than native ease and grace.

Sallust's private character was a subjectos controversy in
ancient as it has also been in modern times, and different opin-
ions havebeen formed in regord to it. The first permanent
allusion to it grew out os the bitterness and animosity of part-i-
san feeling. Sallust, in his general history, had spoken dis·
paragingly of Pompey, and Lenaeus, the latter's freedman,
replicd in an invective full of virulence and slanderous accu-
sations; and though the historianissaid to have been defended
