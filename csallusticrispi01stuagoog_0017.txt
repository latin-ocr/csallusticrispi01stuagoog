X Ltus OF* SALLUS'P.

by Asconius Pedianus, who lived and wrote in the age of Au·
gustus, the unfavorable view cf his character prevailed among
his contemporaries. The Declamatio in Sallustium, purporting
to have been written by Cicero, simply repeats former charges,
and is now very generally believed to have been the work of
Porcius Latro, a rhetorician who lived in the reign ol Claudius.
The identity 01⁶ the historian with the Sallustius whose profli-
gaey is notieed by Horsce in the second satire of the first book,
is merely the result of conjecture, and has nothing moreto
recommend it then identity of name. That, like many of his
distinguished contemporaries, Sallust wss a man of loose morale,
we may eesily believe: the morals of the age were loose; but
thet hc was more than usually ricious we may reasonahly
reluseto believe. Theheat of political controversy is not favor·
hle to the development of truth, and in the ebsence oi reliable
testimony, it is wiser, more just and charitable to accord to
'Sallust a character more in aceordsnee with the cultivated
mind, the good tsste, and the literary ability, which ull must
agree he possessed. 'lhis is the judgment to which the present
age is tending, and the one on which it will doubtless rest.
