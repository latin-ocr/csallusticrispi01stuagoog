oppressed and plundered the people. Certain it is, that though
ho was governor but one year, he amassed enormous wealth.
'lhe N umidians charged him with maladministration, and threat-
ened him with a prosecution sor extortion3 but through the
influence oi Caesar, who is said to have received a portion of
the plunder, he was allowed to escape. He then retired from
public lise, and with the wealth thus aequired he purchased
a villa at Tibur, and laid out, on the Quirinalis, in the suburbe
of Rome, those magnificent gardens which were afterwards
called horti Sallustiani. The beauty ot* these gardens has been
much celebrated, and after the death oi Sallust they became
the retreat ot successive emperors down to the time ot Aure·
lienus. In his villa at Tibur or in the splendid palace sur-
rounded by his gardens, Sallust spent the close of his life in
literary retirement; and it is more than probable that here
also he composed those historiealworks on which his reputation
depende. The story that he married Terentia, the divorced wife
of Cicero, rests on insufficient authority. He died in Β. C. 34.

who had almost exclusively filled the chief offiees os govern-

his strong dislike of the aristocracy, particularly ot its younger
braneh, frequently shows itself in his writings. After his ex·
pulsion from the senate he probably repaired to Caesar's quar-
ters in Gaul, and shared the fortunes os that great commender.

The extant works oi Sallust are two historioal treatises on
selected portione of Roman history: the Catilina, or Bellum
Catilinarium, which unfolds the origin, progress, and suppres
sion of the conspiracy ol Catilina, os which Sallust was himself
an eye-witness3 and the Juyurtta, or Bellum Jayartts'oam,

which describes the varying fortune and the final success of the
Romans in their war with J ugurtha, the wily king os Numidia,
Sallust’s residence in that country probably suggested the work
to him, and enabled him to collect materiale lor it. Besides
these Sallust also wrote a Roman History in live books, of
