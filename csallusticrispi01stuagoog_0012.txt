HE advantages enjoyed by Gerlach and J ordanus in

regard to manuscripts of Sallust have put the text
of that author in the most exact and complete form in
which it is now likely it can appear. The labors of
these scholare have rendered the historiarr more read·
able and attractive: for the sweeping emendations of
Cortius too often corrupted the elegance of Sallust’s style.
The text here presented is accordingly based upon a care·
ful comparison of the approved German editors just
· named. The oldest manuscripts of Sallust date back to
the tenth century.

As Sallust is for the most part used as a preparatory
textbook, the grammatical references and explanations
of construction are very numerous and· full; and the ¹
always interesting subject of antiquities and mythology
forms not the least prominent portion of the notes. Bio-
graphical and historical explanatione are given both in
the Notes and in the Lexicon,

Sallust was very partial to the old phraseology and .
the older forma¹ of the language3 yet, aa the manuscripts,
our ultimate authority, exhibit great variety, it is simply
impossible to present his words as he wrote them. It
has therefore been deemed proper, while avoiding the
widest departures from established usage, to retain what
may be fairly considered the leading and distinctive fea*
tures of the Sallustiau orthography.
